# Boston-Listings

The project is an analysis of AirBnB listings in Boston.


## Introduction

I am using the open dataset available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston . I am analysing the data to answer the following questions:

1. Which are most popular listings in Boston in year 2016
2. Which zip codes in Boston are the most expensive to live in
3. Which is the busiest season in Boston and the owners can increase the prices to increase profits.


## Usage
